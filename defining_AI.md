# What AI Actually Is: You're Probably Wrong

Something that I believe is holding the public back from understanding Artificial Intelligence is that we haven't all converged on acceptable baseline definitions.

Compare this to realms like "climate change", "racial equality", or "economic stability." These notions became clear and accepted through time and the work of their communicators.

This has yet to happen in AI. Are we talking about the robot uprising? Uploading our brains? A branch of philosophy? [Tesla's Autopilot feature?](tesla_link.com)

This is problematic because AI is beginning to proliferate the public thought domain. I want to attempt to clarify what AI is, in order to help two types of readers:

1. Someone who really doesn't know or care about AI, but is intrigued
2. Someone who does, but finds conversations or readings about them to only lead to more confusion

## First: AI is not one idea, and it would serve you well to break it apart

The first thing you have to know is that AI is an umbrella term. Even the sub-terms are umbrella terms. [1] This is the most important mental framework to understand AI.

There are three most popular concepts under the AI umbrella:

1. The Scary Version
2. The Academic Version
3. The Everyday Version (that you see in real life)

## The Scary Version

The scary version is a branch of philosophy that lives at the asymptote of AI thought. At the asymptote, we have to fundamentally rethink what it means to be human, how that is connected with intelligence and sentience, and what the world may look like after we've answered those two.

You can imagine that it brings up the most unanswerable, [2] but most interesting questions:

* What is consciousness – and is it dependent on a biological system, or can it be artificially created?
* What is the difference between biological and non-biological – if DNA is information, and organic molecules physical structure, are humans themselves the end-result of a 4.5 billion year intelligence creation exercise?
* What can humans uniquely do, and what do they uniquely have? Can AI have moral worth, and can it bear emotions?

Its thought-bearers are philosophers, cognitive scientists, and extreme sentimentalists (principally, idealists or pessimists.)

## The Academic Version

The academic, computer-science version of Aritificial Intelligence is starkly different. It is concerned with the creation of some agent – an acting *thing* – that can dynamically achieve its goals in environments.

That's a dry sentence, so let me try with an example: you, when hungry and in a kitchen, must then find an optimal way to satisfy your hunger in the kitchen environment. This illustrates three basic building blocks of the agent in academic AI:

* **Perception.** You intake your environment and process the stimuli you're receiving. You note where the cupboards are, how tall the fridge is, how bright the light is, obstacles on the floor, where you are currently standing.
* **Processing.** You judge your "percepts" to find an optimal solution. You identify that the peanut butter is likely in the cabinet to the left, and to get there you must move around the leftside of the kitchen table, pull it off the shelf, turn and grab a spoon, and stick the peanut butter in your mouth.
* **Actuation.** You use some sort of output device – which may or may not be physical – to achieve your goal. Your legs carry you alongside your path; your arms grasp the right objects; your mouth inhales the peanut butter.

**Why do we have such a formulaic notion of intelligence?** There are two major reasons:

1. It makes it very easy to develop solutions in the real world. This model covers most of what it means to "interact" or "behave" in an environment.
2. It gives purists, theorists, and researchers common ground to move forward on. If they had to keep defining AI every time they started, progress would be slow. (That said, [contrarian and novel philosophy can be exactly what the field needs.](link to philosophy_of_science.com) Perhaps this is like good wine: beneficial in moderation.)

This area is mostly made up of computer scientists, control theory researchers, neuroscientists, and cognitive scientists. [3]

## The Everyday Version (that you see in real life)

This is what inspired Ali and I to start this blog. We wanted to hopefully write good thoughts on how AI is shaping the tangible world around us today. The Everyday Version is:

* Medical diagnostic tools that are more effective than doctors
* Self-driving cars that are safer than humans
* Algorithms that predict the stock market
* Google Translate

Everyday AI is the application of automated "intelligence" to problems in the real-world, **regardless of whether or not that application contriubtes to the Academic or the Scary Versions of intelligence.** [4]

Put more specifically, Everday AI is applying techniques from the advancements made in Academic and Scary AI to affect the daily lives of humans. 

This is what most excites us, and what we'll be exploring on [42ish.com](http://www.42ish.com). We hope to reveal how AI is shaping our everyday, how it is changing as our knowledge of intelligence changes, and **how it is relevant to the choices that you make.**

[1] Something you might also want to do is separate the notions of "intelligence", "consciousness", "sentience", and "will."

[2] In discussions with friends, it's extraordinarily easy to get lost in unproductive, nihilist conversation. I propose two modest common-ground assumptions. First, abandon assumptions about what it means to be human; to think about AI, we must also be willing to rethink what we think it means to be human. Second, anything can happen; a very valuable tool is extremist philosophizing about future states of the world.

[3] Something extraordinary about this area is that some of the greatest advancements have been made by "hacker culture" people with rudimentary ideas of how humans work. Turns out, if you abandon the search for absolute truth in how intelligence and humanity works, and instead focus on making things that behave or think in a real-world way, you can go pretty far.

[4] It seems that every time an advancement in Real-World AI is made, one side scoffs ("that's not intelligence!"), and the other side overplays it as a harbinger of the impending end of the human civilization.

[5] Throw all these notions aside and learn to love the tongue-in-cheek definition of AI: ["whatever hasn't been done yet."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect#AI_is_whatever_hasn.27t_been_done_yet)
