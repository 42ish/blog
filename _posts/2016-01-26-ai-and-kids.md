*Ali and I were sitting in a pub thinking about the pressing issues that AI affects. It seems like you can take any ```[some_important_relevant_topic]```, add "using AI", and then start a business, write a popular blog post, or top the charts with a news article.*

*We settled, naturally, on writing about what sounds like the least relevant topic: **parenting**.*

*Here's my take. You can read Ali's take [here](#).*

## You Should Teach Your Child About Artificial Intelligence

As a PhD student, [I try to predict](http://www.logangraham.xyz/blog/what-i-research) the future of Artificial Intelligence, and its effect on the world around us. When people ask me what I do, I reply that I'm:

The reality is that I am 100% a *Learner* – my job is to learn as quick as I can the crux of several big topics. Over the past 12 months, I've had to train different brain muscles to learn them. There are several things that are easy and interesting enough that I think you could realistically teach a 5 year-old.

Recall your childhood. Do you remember a time when you encountered something that *absolutely enthralled you?* Many of the brightest people I know can trace their work and fascination back to some pivotal point of being fascinated. **I believe we can do that for kids for aritificial intelligence.** So I wanted to share several areas that people invested in building Aritifical Intelligence (myself included), have to learn, that you could, and should, teach your 5-year-old.

These are, in fact, **things I wish my parents had taught me as a tyke.**

## Being Math Positive

Because of AI, the world will increasingly run on math.

One great part of being a part of the Artificial Intelligence community is that it's encouraged for you to daydream and think about robots and a Hitchhiker's Guide-like future. Other times, you have to look at equations like this:

And figure out how it helps you output numbers that teach you something. The secret is – math is a key that unlocks insight. Around our lab, if you need to work out an idea, you grab a whiteboard marker, stand up, and scribble furiously in whatever empty space you can find.

*How do you represent the neurons in a brain with math? How do we model Google Translate? How does a self-driving car decide whether or not a cyclist is in the way?* Think about the fact that each of these questions impacts literally billions of people.

You probably know, however, of the "I'm not a math person" epidemic. You probably know that math talent isn't innate, but inspired and fostered. This is something you must do as a parent. But I'd also add one thing: **develop math naïveté.** Not only can you teach your child to love and be good at math, but they should be so ignorant about their limitations that they believe they can digest any topic, no matter how complex and hairy, with enough time and energy. I love spending my weekends tackling ideas foreign to me. (Which is how I ended up in this PhD anyways.)

*Disclaimer: my parents were actually so math positive, in fact, that I sat naked in the bathtub at 4-years-old doing algebra (calculus came at 11).*

## Cognitive Theory

We aren't even close to figuring how *how humans think.* However, understanding models of cognitive ability will not only help your child become the first person to develop a sentient machine, but also

I didn't start learning cognitive theory until 8 months ago. I'm nowhere close to understanding it, but it profoundly affects me. First, I deeply appreciate my existence as a human – it's hard to learn about the mechanistic and philosophical model of the machinery that underlies our every stimulus response and not come to grips with your mortality and humanity. Secondly, it is broad. It touches biology, information theory, electricity, psychology, computer science.

And, perhaps most importantly, if we are going to create a sentient Artificial Intelligence, we need to understand how *we* are sentient and do what we do – if not to discover the flaws in our wiring and build one that surpasses it.

I would have *loved* learning this as a kid. The developmental milestones you reach as a kid – object permanence, symbolic representations, experimentation – are also building blocks of cognitive theory. To be asked: "what's inside your head?" "Where do you think a thought goes after you are done with it?" "what makes you think?" may entertain a kid endlessly.

## Optimization

Ultimately, a lot of what we do – and what AI involves – is optimizing something. The time it takes to decide something; the accuracy of the car deciding that that is, actually, a bicycle; the number of false-negatives given by cancer diagnosis software.

Kids are obsessed by optimization. They build the biggest lego castle that suits their preferences. They edit the angle of the line of sight between their peas, behind their mashed potatoes, and your eyes as a parent. They learn what to say, and how to say it, in order to get out of having done something bad.

Now, imagine a kid who understood how to design an algorithm to get what they want. How do you optimize learning and finishing homework so that you can spend more time outside? How do you optimize your own happiness? How do you optimize your friendships?

## Ending

I envision myself as a Socrates-like super-tyke: wandering around all day, estimating the numbers of leaves on a tree, questioning how the birds in the leaves make decisions, and figuring out the right way to climb the tree.

I'd probably be a better AI researcher had that been my chilhood.
